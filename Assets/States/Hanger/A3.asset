  storyText: 'A3. Emergency Exit

    Okay, you''re around the corner. No one can
    see you. You think.


    Bit tough to hear yourself think above the thumping
    machinery. However, in front of you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized,
    cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock,
    or maybe look for a way to pry it off.


    What to do?


    1. Pick it.

    2.
    Pry it.'
